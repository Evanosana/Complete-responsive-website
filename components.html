    <h1>Required Components:</h1>
    <div class="flexy flexstart">
        <h3>Graphics Card</h3>

        <div class="flexier">
            <p>
                This is the powerhouse of the computer where all the graphical processing is done,
                Typically this is the component that is what makes your computer good at gaming or not.
                It will almost always be the most expensive component of your build and picking the right
                one is necessary. There is also VRAM which is a subsection of ram that is built into graphics
                cards that handles elements of a game that are constantly changing like different textures that
                are being loaded in the distance that your game is rendering. Once all of your vram is used up
                you will take a massive performance hit as the game will need to use your regular ram that is
                considerably slower.
            </p>
        </div>

    <div class="flexy">
        <h3>Central processing unit</h3>
        <img class="cpu" src="./images/cpureal.webp" alt="CPU">
        <div class="flexier">
            <p>
                This is the brain of the computer that handles everything in the back when it comes to all of your other components,
                it takes information from other parts and transfers it to where it needs to go, It also often times handles AI in video
                games which is why games with many entities are more CPU demanding.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="flexy">
        <h3>Motherboard</h3>
        <img class="mobo" src="./images/mobo.png" alt="Mobo">
        <div class="flexier">
            <p>
                This is the backbone of the computer, It connects everything together and gives the components function,
                It also diverts power from the power supply to the different components that require it.
                Typically, motherboards have a set bios which is what's programmed into the motherboard by the manufacturer
                and different companies have different bios interfaces.
                Lastly it takes commands from the CPU and routes signals to other parts of the computer.
            </p>

    <div class="flexy">
        <h3>Power supply</h3>
        <img class="psu" src="./images/psu.png" alt="PSU">
        <div class="flexier">
            <p>
                This is the life of the computer, It distributes power to the motherboard, cpu, and graphics card if it requires it.
                it is a very simple but necessary part of the computer and without it, you can't turn anything on.
            </p>

        <h3>Solid state drive</h3>

        <div class="flexier">
            <p>
                This is the storage of the computer, Specifically this is an M.2 SSD, There are other types of SSDs or HDDs
                which are hard disk drives, but they are slow and aren't ever recommended anymore,
                There are also sata drives which are connected directly to the motherboard.
                The M.2 drive connects to the slot directly under the cpu, and it gets its power directly from the motherboard,
                Additionally it is where you store all of your data, A lot of people assume that computers either are mac or windows
                but the operating system is dependent on what is installed on your drive, and you need to install an operating system
                to make the system usable.
            </p>

        <h3>Random-Access-Memory or RAM</h3>

            <p>
                This is the part of the computer that handles current storage that is not being saved.
                To elaborate on this imagine a Google Chrome tab, When you open that tab where is that
                data being stored? It is being stored in the random access memory, when you close that tab
                the date is deleted as well, and it is the browsers job to store that data now that your computer
                isn't running it anymore. In video games the render distance is also handed by VRAM.
