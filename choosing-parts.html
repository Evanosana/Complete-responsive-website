        <h3>GPU & CPU</h3>
        <div class="flexier flexer">
            <p>
                When you are pairing the graphics card and the cpu you have a few choices to make,
                firstly you need to decide wether you will be going with amd(radeon) or nvidia or for 
                the cpus intel or amd, the graphics card and cpu will be the most expensive part of the
                build to do as much research as you feel like is necessary and find something.

        <h3>Motherboard</h3>
        <div class="flexier flexer">
            <p>
                You often times don't need a super expensive motherboard because most of them are very reliable
                at a price of around $150 and some people buy $300 motherboards for no reason, only time you would
                want that is if you have a top of the line build and you want expandability. 
            </p>

        <h3>Power supply</h3>
        <div class="flexier flexer">
            <p>
                The power supply should never be underpriced and always go for something reliable under resources
                there will be a way to grade power supplies and which ones are good or bad on the PSU tier list.

        <h3>SSD</h3>
        <div class="flexier flexer">
            <p>
                this component should be around $90+ or it will be slow, you want a minimum of 1tb (terrabyte) and any extra
                is just what you need if 1tb isn't enough for you. There are some more expensive brands like samsung for these
                but sometimes it is better to get something cheaper like teamgroup.

    <div class="flexy flexstart">
        <h3>RAM</h3>
        <div class="flexier flexer">
            <p>
                For RAM you need a minimum of 16gb in this time if you are gaming, if you aren't you could get away with 8gb but
                it isn't recommended ever to do that simply because of how cheap ram is compared to other parts.
