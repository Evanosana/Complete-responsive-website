                To put together parts visually and to store your progress on choosing which parts you want to use,
                I recommend using this website allows you to compile your parts into a list and it will tell you if
                it is compatible with each other and the best price at whatever store that it is best priced at and
                is the best way to plan your build.

            <p>
                To test whether your cpu and gpu are a bottleneck to each other then you should use this site to visualize
                if one part is an issue for the performance side of your build. This site is not 100% accurate and you should
                not take its answer for a definite result but you should consider it while you are looking at parts.

                This is a way to find what power supplies are either great, good, bad, or a safety hazard, and
                you should almost never buy anything under a C and always try to get something higher than that.
